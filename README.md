# CIS229 Chapter 12 Homework
## Mortgage Calculator App

Create a mortgage calculator app using JavaFX that allows the user to enter: 
* a purchase price
* down-payment amount
* an interest rate.

Based on these values, the app should calculate the loan amount (purchase price minus down payment) and display the monthly payment for 10-, 20- and 30-year loans when the user clicks on a button. 

Allow the user to select a custom loan duration (in years) by using a Slider and display the monthly payment for that custom loan duration.
